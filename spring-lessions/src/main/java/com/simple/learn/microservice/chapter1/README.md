<h4>Brief history of microservices? </h4>
<h5> Microservice has emerged from the world of:</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>Domain-driven design</li>
        <li>Continuous delivery</li>
        <li>On-demand virtualization</li>
        <li>Infrastructure automation</li>
        <li>Small autonomous teams</li>
        <li>Systems at scale</li>
    </ul>
Many organizations have found that by embracing the fine-grained
and micro service architecture they can deliver software faster
and embrace new technologies. Micro services gives us significantly
more freedom to react and make different decisions.<br/>

<h5>What are microservices? </h5>
Microservices are small and autonomous services that work together.

Small & Focused on doing one thing well. <br/>
<ul>
<li> Small  <ul>
            <li>Life cycle of service is easily manageable by a single team.</li>
            <li>Easily rewritable in 2 weeks time.</li></ul></li>
<li> Autonomous <ul> <li>Microservice is a separate entity, which is deployed
            as an independent service on a Platform as a service(PAAS).</li>
            <li>All the communications between microservices are via network calls,
            to enforce the separation between services and avoid the perils
            of tight coupling. </li>
            <li>These services need to be able to change 
            independently and be deployed by themselves without requiring 
            consumers to change.</li>
            </ul>
 </ul>
   
Microservice exposes an API, and collaborating services will communicate with us via those API's.

<h5> Key Benefits:</h5>
The benefits of microservice are many and varied. 
Technology heterogeneity - With a system composed of multiple, collaborating services, we can decide to use a different technology inside each one. Right technology for right jon instead of having one stack for the entire application.
